Adding some text
This is the second commit
Sample code

====Git rm====
git rm --ignore-unmatch --cached -> need to remove the staged commits (git restore --staged [path]) and re-commit the existing/working tree changes.

====Git Diff====
Adding changes to test the git diff command
For now, I just let it to be and will be correct it.
